description: Turn documented intent into a test-coverage map — inventory the tests that exist today, derive use-case cases from the system docs, separate existing coverage from proposed tests and unverified gaps, mark each unit / guarded-live / manual, and recommend a green-before-merge CI gate

# /derive-tests -- Turn Intent Into Tests

The docs say what the system *should* do. An audit finds where the code *doesn't*. Tests are what stop that gap from reopening after the next AI edit. This command reads the documented intent, turns each load-bearing rule into a concrete test case, sorts them into what to automate, what needs a guarded live run, and what stays manual — then recommends the CI gate that keeps `main` honest.

This produces a coverage map (`tests.md`) and concrete test cases, not a finished suite — you or the next agent implement the deterministic ones.

## Invocation

```
/derive-tests
/derive-tests the checkout flow
/derive-tests supabase/functions
```

## Prerequisite: documented intent

Tests are derived from the docs, so the docs come first. If `documentation/*.md` is missing or thin, run `/document-app` (and `/derive-tests` reads `flows.md`, `permissions.md`, and `automation.md` most heavily). You cannot map coverage to rules you never wrote down — where intent is absent, say so rather than inventing rules to test.

## The workflow

### 1. Read the intent — and the tests that already exist

Read the applicable system docs (architecture, flows, permissions, variables, and any of emails, cron, seo, automation that exist). Apply the **shipping-artifacts** skill for what each doc should contain, and the **intended-vs-implemented** skill for the discipline of treating docs as claims to verify, not proof.

Then inventory the **existing test suite** — the test files, what they actually assert, and what runs in CI today. The map you produce must distinguish coverage that exists *now* from coverage you're *proposing*; skipping this step yields a falsely-green map that claims rules are pinned when nothing checks them. If there are no tests, say so plainly — that is itself a finding.

### 2. Extract the rules worth testing

Pull out the load-bearing, deterministic rules — the ones whose violation crosses a trust, data, money, tenant, or privacy boundary:

- authorization allow **and deny** cases (especially the boundary crossings in `flows.md` and the matrix in `permissions.md`),
- input validation and output encoding at each sink,
- idempotency of jobs and dedup keys,
- fail-closed defaults (error / timeout / cache-miss / flag paths that must deny, not allow),
- side-effect conditions (exactly when an email sends, a write commits, a paid action fires),
- public-data-only constraints on public or bot routes,
- the output-contract and tool-surface limits of any agent in `automation.md`.

Skip cosmetic behavior. A rule earns a test when getting it wrong harms someone other than the actor.

### 3. Build the coverage map

One row per use case: **rule → expected behavior (incl. the negative case) → evidence source (doc + code) → test type → status (existing / proposed / none)**. The status column is what keeps the map honest — mark a rule *existing* only when a test in the repo actually asserts it today.

Test types:

- **unit** — pure and deterministic, no external services.
- **integration (deterministic)** — exercises real wiring against a local or in-memory dependency (test DB, mocked provider) and runs the same way every time.
- **guarded live** — needs a real external DB, email provider, LLM, or third party. Runs only behind an explicit flag, never in the default CI run.
- **manual** — UI/visual or judgment calls. A reviewer checklist item, not an automated test.

**What CI must require:** the deterministic local set — unit plus deterministic integration tests, the ones that pass or fail the same way on every run with no live dependencies. Prefer **unit** where the decision logic can be isolated; reach for **integration** when the rule lives in the wiring (middleware, RLS, auth guards) and only a real-but-local dependency can exercise it. Guarded-live and manual rows never gate the default run.

When a rule can only be exercised live, you can extract its *decision* into a pure helper so the logic is unit-testable — but only as a **complement, not a replacement** for testing the real enforcement. The unit test proves the helper's logic; it does **not** prove the framework actually calls it. Wiring and policy enforcement (route middleware, DB row-level security, auth guards, provider config) still needs an integration or guarded-live check, or the helper becomes a policy shadow that passes while the real path is unprotected.

### 4. Propose the tests

For each rule you can pin with a deterministic automated test (unit or integration), write the case: name, arrange/act/assert intent, and the negative case it must reject. Group cases by the doc or flow they defend. Prefer the smallest test that pins the rule — one clear assertion per boundary beats a sprawling integration test that fails for ten reasons.

### 5. Recommend the CI gate

Recommend — don't silently install — a CI setup matched to the repo's stack and existing tooling:

- run the **deterministic local set on every pull request** (unit + any integration test that runs without live services),
- keep **guarded-live tests opt-in** (manual or scheduled, never blocking),
- **gate merges to `main` on green** via a required status check + branch protection.

Output the workflow file and the branch-protection setting as a clearly-labeled suggestion for the user to approve, not an applied change.

### 6. Report coverage and gaps

Write `tests.md` in three clearly separated sections:

- **Existing coverage** — rules a test in the repo pins *today* (from the Step 1 inventory).
- **Proposed tests** — the cases you're recommending but that don't exist yet, by type.
- **Gaps** — documented rules with **no verification at all**, ranked by what crossing them exposes.

The gaps are the backlog, and they are exactly where the next AI edit can silently break a boundary. Be honest that proposed ≠ existing: a rule isn't covered until a test actually asserts it.

## Output

```
Test Coverage: [scope]

| Use case | Rule (doc) | Expected behavior (+ deny case) | Evidence | Type | Status |
|----------|-----------|---------------------------------|----------|------|--------|
[status: existing / proposed / none]

### Existing coverage
[tests already in the repo, each tied to the rule it pins]

### Proposed tests
[grouped by flow/doc — name · assert · negative case · type]

### Recommended CI gate
[workflow snippet for the detected stack + "green-before-merge" branch-protection note]

### Gaps — documented but unverified
[rules with no test yet, ranked by what crossing them exposes]
```

Write the coverage map to `documentation/tests.md` and the full report to `reports/test_plan_{timestamp}.md`, and give the user both paths.

## Notes

- This is the verification half of "documented == implemented": the audits find today's gap, these tests stop it from reopening tomorrow.
- Don't fabricate rules to manufacture coverage. If the docs are silent, the gap is in the docs — fix `/document-app` first.
- Don't wire external services into the default CI run; flaky live tests erode the green-before-merge gate until people start ignoring it.
- Covers test derivation only. For the gap audit itself use `/security-audit-static`; for the full document → audit → test → packet sequence use `/ship-check`.
