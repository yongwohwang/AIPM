## Invocation

```

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather Context

Ask:
- What product or service?
- What data is collected? (personal info, usage data, cookies, location, payment)
- Where are your users? (determines applicable regulations: GDPR, CCPA, etc.)
- Any third-party data sharing? (analytics, advertising, integrations)
- Data storage: where and how long?
- Age restrictions? (COPPA considerations)

### Step 2: Draft the Policy

Apply the **privacy-policy** skill:

Generate sections covering:
- What data is collected and how
- How data is used (purposes)
- Legal basis for processing (GDPR)
- Data sharing and third parties
- Data retention and deletion
- User rights (access, deletion, portability, opt-out)
- Cookie policy
- Security measures
- Children's privacy (if applicable)
- International transfers
- Contact information
- Policy update process

## Notes

- This is a template — legal counsel should review before publishing
- GDPR and CCPA have specific requirements that can't be approximated — flag where expert review is essential
- Privacy policies should be in plain language, not legalese
- Update the policy when data practices change, not just annually
